# Harbour Ramp Snap for Metamask

This snap enables seamless authentication with the Harbour API, through the MetaMask wallet.
It works by deriving a keypair deterministically from a MetaMask wallet, and using it to sign every message sent to the
Harbour API.

This way, Harbour users only have to connect their wallet once, install the Snap, link the wallet to their account, and
from that moment onwards they can operate on the dedicated [ramp website](https://snap.harbour.fi/) for buying and
selling crypto, without ever having to remember a password or inserting OTPs.
